# IBM-Data-Science-Project
A complete data science project, consisting of data collection, data wrangling, data analysis, visualization, prediction, and presentation.

For this project, we are working as a data scientist for a company SpaceY competing with an established giant company, and we aim to determine the price of each rocket launch. We will do this by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards for our team. We will also determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, We will train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
