In this project, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. 

Step 1.1: Data collection using API

API: Application Programming Interface

REST API: Representational State Transfer API
consists of a request and a response 
request--> header, operation, endpoint, param/body
operations are CRUD Post Get Put Delete

APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. (Data Pipelines).
The data is in JSON format and we convert it into a pandas dataframe.

We use the SpaceX Rest API for collecting information about past launches.

The code for the same is in "Data_collection_API_Space Y" file
and the data collected is in "dataset1.csv"


Step 1.2 Data collection using Web Scraping

Some websites do not provide API, so we use web scraping to get the data
Beautiful Soup is a famous library used for Web Scraping purposes that present the extracted data in an HTML format and also provides many functions in order to successfully extract data from the HTML Doc

The code for the same is attached in "Data_Collection_Web_Scraping" file
and the data obtained is attached in "spacex_web_scraped.csv"

Step 2: Data Wrangling

Here we make alterations in the dataset and try to determine the training labels in the dataset for training the supervised learning models.
The notebook is attached "Data_Wrangling_SpaceX"
and the updated dataset is "dataset_part_2.csv"
