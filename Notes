Step 1: Data collection using API

API: Application Programming Interface

REST API: Representational State Transfer API
consists of a request and a response 
request--> header, operation, endpoint, param/body
operations are CRUD Post Get Put Delete

APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. (Data Pipelines).
The data is in JSON format and we convert it into a pandas dataframe.

We use the SpaceX Rest API for collecting information about past launches.
